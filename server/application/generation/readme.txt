Capstone/server/application/generation
===============================================================================
    This directory contains the classes used in the generation of game
maps, only utilized by the admin model at this time.

    This is esseentially the extent of the documentation on this dirtory
excluding any functionality happening to be self documenting. Partially, this 
is a result of laziness, but also, the methodoloy behind this system is 
nonsense and the structure is a mess. It will be thrown out, rebuilt, and
properly documented in the future.
