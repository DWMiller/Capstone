Capstone/server/apidocs
===============================================================================
   
    This directory contains the prepared api documentation. This 
documentation is an ajax dependent website itself, and to be 
properly viewed will need to be accessed with the web server running.

    With the web server active, navigate to 
http://localhost:8080/Capstone/ Here you will find links to either view
the client or view the api documentation.    

    There is no additional documentation on this directory, due to a preference
to avoid the endless loop that is documenting documentation. Generally, all
files are just basic HTML with some light CSS, intended to convey content
and little else.
