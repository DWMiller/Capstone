Capstone/client/js/modules
=============================================================================== 
	This is where the bulk of application functionality may be found.
Each module generally focuses on a specific aspect of functionality.

    An attempt has been made to begin organizing modules into logical
categories, defined in the subdirectories below. However, this is still a work 
in progress and far from a perfect indication of what type of functionality a
module is limited to.

    Subdirectories
    ===========================================================================   

        controllers
    	=======================================================================
            Controller modules are modules generally responsible for stopping
        and starting other modules.

        presentation
    	=======================================================================
            Presentation modules are modules bound to a specific element of the
        dom. As such, they are responsible for handling all aspects of
        user interaction and visual updates for that particular element.
       
        services
    	=======================================================================
            Services are modules that handle various processes that do not
        involve direct interaction with content. This includes tasks such as
        data management and server interactions.
