Project Root
===============================================================================
    This is the root of the project, nothing of note here, just a container for
the subdirectories. Read below for a quick outline of the structure of the 
documentation within this project and some general information about the 
project.

    Project Documentation
    ===========================================================================
    	Most major directories will have a readme.txt file, just like this one.
    These files exist to give you an overview of the purpose of that directory,
    and the type of files it contains.

        If a directory does not contain a readme.txt, the likely explanation is
    that it's purpose was deemed self-evident, and further details may be found 
    in the files themselves. If a directory contains a single file, a 
    readme.txt will likely not exist in favour of documenting only that file.


        When file paths are provided, they may be assumed to be relative to the
    directory of the readme.txt file, unless otherwise indicated by the
    inclusion of parent directories.

    	Finally, every readme.txt file should contain brief descriptions of any
    direct child directories, demonstrated at the end of this file.

    	So, good luck and if you're lost, remember to look for the readme.txt.


    Subdirectories
